description: Generate a requirements.md file for a todo app
---

I need to create a requirements.md file for a simple todo list web application.

The todo app should:
- Allow users to add, complete, and delete todos
- Persist data using localStorage
- Work entirely in the browser (no backend)
- Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Please help me create a comprehensive requirements.md file with:
- **Functional Requirements**: What the todo app must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, usability, browser compatibility
- **Constraints**: Technical limitations (vanilla JS, localStorage, etc.)
- **Out of Scope**: Features we're NOT building (like multi-user, cloud sync, etc.)

Create the requirements.md file in my workspace.
