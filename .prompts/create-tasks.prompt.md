description: Generate a tasks.md file for implementing the todo app
---

I need to create a tasks.md file breaking down the implementation of my todo app.

Based on the requirements and design we created earlier, please help me create:
- **Sprint 1**: Core Setup & Basic UI (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript setup)
- **Sprint 2**: Core Functionality (Add todos, render list, toggle complete, delete todos)
- **Sprint 3**: Persistence & Polish (localStorage, empty state, final touches)

For each task, include:
- **Specific subtasks**: Actionable items with checkboxes
- **Time estimates**: Realistic effort (0.5-2 hours each)
- **Dependencies**: What must be done first
- **Acceptance criteria**: How to know when it's complete

Please create the tasks.md file in my workspace with a detailed breakdown of all implementation steps.
