name: Spec Mode - Todo App
description: Build the same todo app with Spec mode (structured approach)
---

I want to build a todo list application using Spec mode with proper planning.

I have already created requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md in my workspace.

Please review these spec files and help me implement the todo app according to the specifications. Let's work through the tasks systematically:

1. First, review the requirements to understand what we're building
2. Check the design document for the technical approach
3. Follow the task breakdown in tasks.md
4. Build the app step by step according to the plan

Let's start by reviewing the spec files and then begin implementation!
