description: Start a full Spec session with requirements, design, and tasks

I want to build this project using Spec mode with proper documentation.

Please help me create:
1. **requirements.md** - Detailed requirements with functional and non-functional specs
2. **design.md** - Technical design with architecture decisions and rationale
3. **tasks.md** - Breakdown of implementation tasks with time estimates

Let's do this systematically and thoroughly!
