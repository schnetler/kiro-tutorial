description: Generate a design.md file for a todo app
---

I need to create a design.md file for my todo list web application.

Based on the requirements we defined earlier (or create new requirements if they don't exist), please help me document:
- **Architecture Overview**: How the app is structured (Model-View pattern, SPA)
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, localStorage
- **System Components**: UI Layer, TodoManager, Event Handlers
- **Data Models**: Todo item structure (id, text, completed, createdAt)
- **Design Decisions**: Why vanilla JS instead of frameworks, why localStorage, why timestamp IDs, etc.

Please create the design.md file in my workspace with clear explanations and rationale for each decision.
