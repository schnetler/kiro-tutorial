I want to build a simple todo list application in Vibe mode!

Let's create a web app with these features:
- Add new todos
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Delete todos
- Persist todos using localStorage

Tech stack:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (keep it simple!)
- No frameworks needed
- Modern ES6+ syntax

Let's start by creating the basic HTML structure and UI, then add the JavaScript functionality. Keep it clean and simple!

After creating the HTML file, please open it in the browser so I can see it working!
