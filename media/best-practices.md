# Best Practices & Next Steps

Congratulations! You've learned the fundamentals of Kiro. Here are some tips to get the most out of spec-driven development.

## Documentation Best Practices

### ✅ Start Small
You don't need perfect specs on day one. Start with a basic outline and refine as you go.

### ✅ Keep It Current
Update your specs as you learn. Stale documentation is worse than none.

### ✅ Be Specific
Vague requirements lead to vague implementations. Be as concrete as possible.

### ✅ Explain Why
Document the rationale for decisions. Your future self will thank you.

## Task Management Tips

### 📏 Right-Size Tasks
Tasks should be 1-4 hours. Bigger tasks are projects in disguise—break them down.

### 🔗 Track Dependencies
Make task order explicit to avoid blocking issues.

### ✓ Define "Done"
Include acceptance criteria for each task so you know when it's complete.

### 📅 Regular Reviews
Review and update tasks weekly or at sprint boundaries.

## Working with Hooks

### 🎯 Start Simple
Begin with a basic context injection hook before trying advanced patterns.

### 🧪 Test Your Hooks
Verify hooks work as expected in different scenarios.

### ⚖️ Don't Overload
Too much context can be overwhelming. Be selective about what you inject.

### 🔄 Iterate
Refine your hooks based on what's actually helpful in practice.

## Team Collaboration

### 🤝 Use Version Control
Keep spec files in git alongside your code.

### 👥 Collaborative Editing
Review specs together during planning sessions.

### 📋 Clear Ownership
Assign owners to different sections or components.

### 📐 Template Consistency
Use consistent formats across all team projects.

## Next Steps

### 1. Start Your First Project
Create requirements.md for a real project you're working on.

### 2. Share with Your Team
Introduce Kiro to your teammates and establish conventions.

### 3. Integrate with AI Tools
Use your specs with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, or ChatGPT.

### 4. Iterate and Improve
Refine your approach based on what works for you.
