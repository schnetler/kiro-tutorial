# The Kiro Workflow

Now that you understand the three core documents, let's see how they work together in your development process.

## The Iterative Development Cycle

```
1. Write Requirements → 2. Design Solution → 3. Create Tasks → 4. Execute → 5. Refine
                                                                            ↓
                                                                      Update Specs ←┘
```

### 1. Start with Requirements
Write down what you need to build in `requirements.md`. Get feedback and refine before moving forward.

### 2. Design Your Solution
Based on requirements, create your technical design in `design.md`. Consider alternatives and document your decisions.

### 3. Break Down Into Tasks
Convert your design into concrete tasks in `tasks.md`. Estimate time and identify dependencies.

### 4. Execute Tasks
Work through tasks one by one, checking them off as you complete them.

### 5. Update and Refine
As you learn new information or face challenges, **update your specs**. These are living documents!

## Key Principles

### 📝 Document as You Go
Don't wait until the end. Update specs continuously.

### 🔄 Iterate and Evolve
Your understanding grows as you build. Let your specs evolve with it.

### 🤝 Collaborate
Share specs with team members and AI assistants for better results.

### ✅ Track Progress
Use tasks.md to see what's done and what's next at a glance.

## Working with AI Agents

Kiro specs are especially powerful with AI coding assistants. The specs provide context that helps AI:
- Understand your project goals
- Make decisions aligned with your architecture
- Generate code that fits your patterns
- Suggest improvements based on requirements
