# Welcome to Kiro!

Kiro is a **spec-driven development framework** that helps you build software systematically by organizing your project into three key documents:

## The Three Pillars of Kiro

📋 **requirements.md** - What your software needs to do
🏗️ **design.md** - How you'll build it
✅ **tasks.md** - Concrete steps to implement it

## Why Spec-Driven Development?

- **Clear Documentation** - Everyone understands the project goals and decisions
- **Better Collaboration** - Works seamlessly with team members and AI agents
- **Track Progress** - See what's done and what's next
- **Reduce Ambiguity** - No more guessing what needs to be built

## What You'll Learn

In this walkthrough, you'll:
- Create your first Kiro spec files
