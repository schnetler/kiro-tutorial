# Creating tasks.md

The `tasks.md` file contains concrete, actionable tasks to implement your design. It answers: **"What specific steps do we take?"**

## What Goes in tasks.md?

### Organized by Sprint/Phase
Break your work into manageable chunks:
- Sprint 1: Foundation
- Sprint 2: Core Features
- Sprint 3: Polish and Testing

### Individual Tasks
Each task should include:
- **Clear objective** - What you're building
- **Subtasks** - Checkboxes for progress tracking
- **Time estimate** - How long it should take
- **Dependencies** - What must be done first

### Example Task Structure

```markdown
### Task 1.1: Set up project structure
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Set up folder structure
- [ ] Create basic Express server
**Estimated time**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: None
```

## Best Practices

✅ Keep tasks small (1-4 hours each)
✅ Make them specific and actionable
✅ Include acceptance criteria
✅ Track dependencies explicitly
✅ Update as you learn

**💡 Pro Tip:** A good task can be completed in one sitting. If it's bigger, break it down into subtasks.
