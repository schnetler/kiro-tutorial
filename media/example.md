## What to Do Next

After creating the example:

1. **📖 Read Through** - Open each file and see how they connect
2. **✏️ Customize** - Modify the example for your own project
3. **🤖 Try with AI** - Start a conversation with an AI assistant and see how hooks work
4. **🔄 Iterate** - Update the specs as you build

## Click to Create!
